# Nanowire simulation for probabilistic programming

We aim to achieve probabilistic programming through nanowires to explore the intersection between quantum phenomena and probabilistic programming (superconducting). This work may establish a link between quantum programming and probabilistic programming, supporting further research in this area.

This study will present an analog circuit of a nanowire implemented using Python and LTspice to simulate the probabilistic process and demonstrate the potential of nanowires for probabilistic computing. Additionally, it will provide a reference for future experimental work.

This simulation project includes the circuit designed for probabilistic programming, a sub-circuit that provides the properties of the nanowire, and the Python scripts used to generate the physical data and summarise the results.
